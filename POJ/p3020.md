# POJ 3020 Antenna Placement
Time Limit: 1000MS	 	Memory Limit: 65536K
# Description

The Global Aerial Research Centre has been allotted the task of building the fifth generation of mobile phone nets in Sweden. The most striking reason why they got the job, is their discovery of a new, highly noise resistant, antenna. It is called 4DAir, and comes in four types. Each type can only transmit and receive signals in a direction aligned with a (slightly skewed) latitudinal and longitudinal grid, because of the interacting electromagnetic field of the earth. The four types correspond to antennas operating in the directions north, west, south, and east, respectively. Below is an example picture of places of interest, depicted by twelve small rings, and nine 4DAir antennas depicted by ellipses covering them.

Obviously, it is desirable to use as few antennas as possible, but still provide coverage for each place of interest. We model the problem as follows: Let A be a rectangular matrix describing the surface of Sweden, where an entry of A either is a point of interest, which must be covered by at least one antenna, or empty space. Antennas can only be positioned at an entry in A. When an antenna is placed at row r and column c, this entry is considered covered, but also one of the neighbouring entries (c+1,r),(c,r+1),(c-1,r), or (c,r-1), is covered depending on the type chosen for this particular antenna. What is the least number of antennas for which there exists a placement in A such that all points of interest are covered?
# Input

On the first row of input is a single positive integer n, specifying the number of scenarios that follow. Each scenario begins with a row containing two positive integers h and w, with 1 <= h <= 40 and 0 < w <= 10. Thereafter is a matrix presented, describing the points of interest in Sweden in the form of h lines, each containing w characters from the set ['*','o']. A '*'-character symbolises a point of interest, whereas a 'o'-character represents open space.

## Output

For each scenario, output the minimum number of antennas necessary to cover all '*'-entries in the scenario's matrix, on a row of its own.

## Solve

题目大意：给定一个矩形，其中有数个城市（用'*'表示），空地用'o'表示，现在这些城市都要覆盖无线网络，若放置一个基站，那么它至多可以覆盖相邻的两个城市。问至少放置多少个基站才能使得所有的城市都覆盖无线网络？

最小路径覆盖 参见二分图大讲堂

1.构建二分图，原图中的每个城市C拆成Cx和Cy,如果城市C1四周存在C2，那么就加边C1x-C2y。这样就得到了一个无向的二分图。
2.求最大匹配数 城市数-最大匹配数/2(除去拆边后多出来的一半)即为最小路径覆盖数
