# POJ 3253 Fence Repair
Time Limit: 2000MS	 	Memory Limit: 65536K
## Description

Farmer John wants to repair a small length of the fence around the pasture. He measures the fence and finds that he needs N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20,000) planks of wood, each having some integer length Li (1 ≤ Li ≤ 50,000) units. He then purchases a single long board just long enough to saw into the N planks (i.e., whose length is the sum of the lengths Li). FJ is ignoring the "kerf", the extra length lost to sawdust when a sawcut is made; you should ignore it, too.

FJ sadly realizes that he doesn't own a saw with which to cut the wood, so he mosies over to Farmer Don's Farm with this long board and politely asks if he may borrow a saw.

Farmer Don, a closet capitalist, doesn't lend FJ a saw but instead offers to charge Farmer John for each of the N-1 cuts in the plank. The charge to cut a piece of wood is exactly equal to its length. Cutting a plank of length 21 costs 21 cents.

Farmer Don then lets Farmer John decide the order and locations to cut the plank. Help Farmer John determine the minimum amount of money he can spend to create the N planks. FJ knows that he can cut the board in various different orders which will result in different charges since the resulting intermediate planks are of different lengths.

## Input

Line 1: One integer N, the number of planks
Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single integer describing the length of a needed plank
## Output

Line 1: One integer: the minimum amount of money he must spend to make N-1 cuts
## Sample Input

3
8
5
8
## Sample Output

34
# Hint

He wants to cut a board of length 21 into pieces of lengths 8, 5, and 8.
The original board measures 8+5+8=21. The first cut will cost 21, and should be used to cut the board into pieces measuring 13 and 8. The second cut will cost 13, and should be used to cut the 13 into 8 and 5. This would cost 21+13=34. If the 21 was cut into 16 and 5 instead, the second cut would cost 16 for a total of 37 (which is more than 34).

题目大意：给定所需要的木板，现有的木板长度之和恰好为所以所需木板的长度之和，每次切割的花费为切割木板的长度，问得到所需木板所需的最小花费是

可以转换为哈夫曼树求解

哈夫曼数的定义

给定n个权值作为n个叶子结点，构造一棵二叉树，若带权路径长度达到最小，称这样的二叉树为最优二叉树，也称为哈夫曼树(Huffman Tree)。哈夫曼树是带权路径长度最短的树，权值较大的结点离根较近。

在这里路径的权值就是切割该木板的花费

构造过程

假设有n个权值，则构造出的哈夫曼树有n个叶子结点。 n个权值分别设为 w1、w2、…、wn，则哈夫曼树的构造规则为：

将w1、w2、…，wn看成是有n 棵树的森林(每棵树仅有一个结点)；
在森林中选出两个根结点的权值最小的树合并，作为一棵新树的左、右子树，且新树的根结点权值为其左、右子树根结点权值之和；
从森林中删除选取的两棵树，并将新树加入森林；
重复2、3步，直到森林中只剩一棵树为止，该树即为所求得的哈夫曼树。

解题代码

```cpp
#include<cstdio>
#include<queue>
#include<vector>
#define MAXN 1000
int n;
long long ans;
std::priority_queue<int, std::vector, std::greater >q;//利用STL创建一个数越小优先级越高的优先队列 
int main(){
	int x,y,t;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){ scanf("%d",&x); q.push(x); } 
        if(q.size()==1){//特判 
            printf("%d",q.top()); 
            return 0; 
        } 
        while(q.size()>1){
	    x=q.top();q.pop();
            y=q.top();q.pop();
            t=x+y;//每次取出两个最小的 作为新节点的左右儿子 新节点权值为它们之和 
            ans+=t;//花费为它们之和
            q.push(t);//把形成的新树加入森林 
	}
	printf("%lld",ans);
	return 0;
}
```
PS：注意ans的范围
